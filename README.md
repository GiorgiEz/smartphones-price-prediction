## Introduction
With the growing demand for smartphones, understanding pricing strategies is critical for manufacturers and retailers. This project utilizes machine learning models to predict smartphone prices based on various specifications and features provided in a dataset of 980 smartphones.

## Dataset Description
The original dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhijitdahatonde/real-world-smartphones-dataset

The dataset contains 980 rows and 22 columns, capturing various attributes of smartphones, including:
- **brand_name**: The manufacturerâ€™s name.
- **model**: The specific model of the smartphone.
- **price**: The price of the smartphone in INR.
- **avg_rating**: The average customer rating.
- **5g_or_not**: A Boolean value representing if the phone has 5G support or not.
- **processor_brand**: The brand of the processor used in the smartphone.
- **num_cores**: The number of cores in the smartphone's processor.
- **processor_speed**: The clock speed of the processor in GHz.
- **battery_capacity**: The battery capacity of the smartphone in mAh.
- **fast_charging_available**: Indicates whether the phone supports fast charging (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- **fast_charging**: The wattage of the fast charging feature (if available).
- **ram_capacity**: The amount of RAM in GB.
- **internal_memory**: The internal storage capacity of the smartphone in GB.
- **screen_size**: The diagonal screen size in inches.
- **refresh_rate**: The screen refresh rate in Hz.
- **num_rear_cameras**: The number of rear cameras on the smartphone.
- **os**: The operating system of the smartphone (e.g., Android, iOS).
- **primary_camera_rear**: The resolution of the primary rear camera in megapixels.
- **primary_camera_front**: The resolution of the front camera in megapixels.
- **extended_memory_available**: Indicates whether the phone supports expandable storage (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- **resolution_height**: The height of the screen resolution in pixels.
- **resolution_width**: The width of the screen resolution in pixels.

## Project Objectives
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and analyze the relationships between features and target variables.
3. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models to predict smartphone price.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Compare the performance of different models and identify the most effective ones.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GiorgiEz/smartphones-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd smartphones-price-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Main.py file in folder main:
   ```bash
   python Main.py
   ```

## Data Preprocessing
In this project, the dataset underwent several preprocessing steps to ensure data quality and suitability for analysis. These steps included:

- Initial Data Exploration: Gaining insights into the dataset's structure, content, and potential issues by examining its shape, descriptive statistics, data types, and missing values.
- Data Cleaning:
  - Dropping irrelevant columns (e.g., fast_charging_available).
  - Converting the price column from Indian Rupees (INR) to US Dollars (USD) for consistency.
- Outlier Handling: Identifying and addressing outliers in each column to prevent them from skewing the analysis. This involved checking for negative values and other anomalies.
- Missing Value Imputation: Filling in missing values using appropriate strategies such as mean, median, mode imputation, or assigning default values based on the column's characteristics.
- Duplicate Removal: Removing duplicate entries based on the model column to ensure data uniqueness and prevent redundancy in the analysis.

These preprocessing steps ensure that the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for further analysis and modeling.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) focused on uncovering key insights and trends in the smartphone dataset using various visualizations:

- Price Analysis
   - Explored correlations between price and other features with correlation bar plots.
   - Visualized price distributions and compared pricing for smartphones with and without 5G.

- Rating Insights
   - Examined the distribution of average ratings and their relationship with price to understand how customer satisfaction aligns with cost.

- Brand Analysis
   - Displayed brand distributions to highlight the most common brands.
   - Analyzed average price and ratings by brand, with pie charts illustrating features like 5G and fast charging adoption across brands.
   - Investigated brand trends for rear camera counts and visualized their averages.

- Model Highlights
   - Compared the most expensive and highest-rated models side by side to identify standout devices.
   - Used pie charts to show 5G and memory availability distributions across models.
   - Created visual comparisons for pricing trends among 5G and non-5G smartphones.

- General Insights
   - Assessed processor speed by brand using strip plots for clarity.
   - Visualized OS distributions through pie charts.

These visualizations enable a deep dive into the dataset, shedding light on important features and trends that could impact further analysis or decision-making.

## Model Training and Evaluation

In this project, multiple machine learning models are trained and evaluated on a dataset to predict smartphone price. The following models are used:

- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**

Each model is trained on the same dataset. The dataset is preprocessed using one-hot encoding and frequency encoding.
The models are evaluated based on the following metrics:
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
- **R2 (R-squared)**

## Results

### Training Random Forest:
| Metric | Scores |
|--------|--------|
| MSE    | 15663  |
| MAE    | 64     |
| R2     | 0.88   |

### Training Gradient Boosting:
| Metric | Scores |
|--------|--------|
| MSE    | 19514  |
| MAE    | 85     |
| R2     | 0.85   |

## Price Prediction

We can enter the input and actual price of the phone in price_prediction/predict.py and run the predict.py to get the predicted results.

## Future Work
- Expand the dataset with more recent smartphone data.
- Integrate additional features such as market demand or customer reviews.
- Explore advanced models for improved prediction accuracy.
