## Introduction
With the growing demand for smartphones, understanding pricing strategies is critical for manufacturers and retailers. This project utilizes machine learning models to predict smartphone prices based on various specifications and features provided in a dataset of 980 smartphones.

## Dataset Description
The original dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhijitdahatonde/real-world-smartphones-dataset

The dataset contains 980 rows and 22 columns, capturing various attributes of smartphones, including:
- **brand_name**: The manufacturerâ€™s name.
- **model**: The specific model of the smartphone.
- **price**: The price of the smartphone in INR.
- **avg_rating**: The average customer rating.
- **5g_or_not**: A Boolean value representing if the phone has 5G support or not.
- **processor_brand**: The brand of the processor used in the smartphone.
- **num_cores**: The number of cores in the smartphone's processor.
- **processor_speed**: The clock speed of the processor in GHz.
- **battery_capacity**: The battery capacity of the smartphone in mAh.
- **fast_charging_available**: Indicates whether the phone supports fast charging (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- **fast_charging**: The wattage of the fast charging feature (if available).
- **ram_capacity**: The amount of RAM in GB.
- **internal_memory**: The internal storage capacity of the smartphone in GB.
- **screen_size**: The diagonal screen size in inches.
- **refresh_rate**: The screen refresh rate in Hz.
- **num_rear_cameras**: The number of rear cameras on the smartphone.
- **os**: The operating system of the smartphone (e.g., Android, iOS).
- **primary_camera_rear**: The resolution of the primary rear camera in megapixels.
- **primary_camera_front**: The resolution of the front camera in megapixels.
- **extended_memory_available**: Indicates whether the phone supports expandable storage (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- **resolution_height**: The height of the screen resolution in pixels.
- **resolution_width**: The width of the screen resolution in pixels.

## Project Objectives
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and analyze the relationships between features and target variables.
3. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models to predict smartphone price.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Compare the performance of different models and identify the most effective ones.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GiorgiEz/smartphones-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd smartphones-price-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Main.py file in folder main:
   ```bash
   python Main.py
   ```

## Data Preprocessing
- Get insights about the dataset shape, description, information and null values.
- Drop fast_charging_available column and convert price column from INR to USD.
- Handling outliers by inspecting each column, checking if there's any negative values, etc.
- Filling missing values by either mean, median, mode or by creating default value.
- Removing duplicates based on column 'model'.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) focused on uncovering key insights and trends in the smartphone dataset using various visualizations:

- Price Analysis
   - Explored correlations between price and other features with correlation bar plots.
   - Visualized price distributions and compared pricing for smartphones with and without 5G.

- Rating Insights
   - Examined the distribution of average ratings and their relationship with price to understand how customer satisfaction aligns with cost.

- Brand Analysis
   - Displayed brand distributions to highlight the most common brands.
   - Analyzed average price and ratings by brand, with pie charts illustrating features like 5G and fast charging adoption across brands.
   - Investigated brand trends for rear camera counts and visualized their averages.

- Model Highlights
   - Compared the most expensive and highest-rated models side by side to identify standout devices.
   - Used pie charts to show 5G and memory availability distributions across models.
   - Created visual comparisons for pricing trends among 5G and non-5G smartphones.

- General Insights
   - Assessed processor speed by brand using strip plots for clarity.
   - Visualized OS distributions through pie charts.

These visualizations enable a deep dive into the dataset, shedding light on important features and trends that could impact further analysis or decision-making.
